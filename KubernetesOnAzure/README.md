### 11:30 AM: AKS on Azure Stack HCI
##### Abhilasha Agarwala, Program Manager, Azure Edge and Platform
Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack HCI is an on-premises implementation of the popular Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) orchestrator, which automates running containerized applications at scale. Azure Kubernetes Service is now in preview on Azure Stack HCI, making it quicker to get started hosting Linux and Windows containers in your datacenter.

### 12:00 PM: First Look: OSM integration with AKS
#### Phillip Gibson – Senior Program Manager
Open Service Mesh is a lightweight and extensible cloud native service mesh that takes a simple approach for users to uniformly manage, secure, and get out-of-the box observability features for highly dynamic microservices environments. The Azure AKS and Network teams have been hard at work to integrate OSM with the managed AKS service. Here is an early first look at how some of the upcoming integration and experience will look like.

### 12:30 PM: Identity management in distributed applications using Dapr 	
##### Mark Chmarny, Principal Program Manager

Dapr makes microservice development easier in any language. Using its consistent APIs and reusable building blocks, developers can quickly build distributed applications that are both dynamic and portable. 
 
To secure these applications, Dapr provides automatic in-transit encryption using mutual TLS, SPIFFE-based application identity, and a granular set of easy to configure runtime access control policies.  
 
This session will review these options with a live demo of: 
 
- Trust relationship definition between microservices 
- Operation-level access policy  
- Per-application component scoping  
- Application-level access controls for secrets
